Fundamental to all web applications is HTML.
In the browser, we use the Document Object Model (DOM) to manipulate HTML
with JavaScript.

## HTML

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) looks like this

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

When you see text enclosed in the `<` and `>` characters, those are called **tags**.
Tags come in pairs: opening and closing tags. The closing tags have a forward slash
`/` to distinguish them from opening tags.

Some of the basic tags have really short tagnames, like `p` for paragraph.
Some are acronyms, like `html` which is the tag that should wrap you entire HTML
document. Some, like `section`, are full words. It's a bit overwhelming at first,
but rest assured you won't have to memorize much HTML. You can search for what you
need and slowly pick the tagnames up over time.

## SVG

Scalable vector graphics (SVG) is a graphics language. SVG gives the computer
instructions on how to draw shapes. You can tell the computer to draw a circle
of a certain size and color, centered about a particular coordinate.

## index.html

The only file in this directory should be `index.html`. Open up this file in a text
editor and all open it up in a web browser. Add some text and refresh the page.
Experiment with HTML. Find some new HTML tags to add and see how it changes the page.
The file comes with a SVG tag and a circle tag. Try adding another circle. Try
changing the numbers.
