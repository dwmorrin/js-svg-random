# Fun with SVG

## What this does

The JavaScript generates random SVG elements and animates them.

## Background & target audience

I've created variations of this code several times since learning JavaScript.
I think it's a good project for absolute web app beginners who have no
experience in HTML, CSS, and JS to make something visually interesting.

## Usage

To keep things super simple, this project should be run with the file protocol
e.g.
`file:///path/to/index.html`

Using the file protocol, as opposed to HTTP, means you don't have to run a
server to play with the code in a browser.

## TODO

- Currently working on the "final" code, which beginners are **not** intended to
  comprehend. This should be moved to a "final" directory.
- Add a series of ordered directories to guide a beginner from zero to "final".
